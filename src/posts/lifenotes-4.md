Hey there, friends! You're getting a 4 for the price of 1 special this time, as I've spent the last 4 weeks or so in an a bit of a hole. Good news is: I'm feeling a bit better 🙂

Maybe all I needed was to do absolutely nothing except play Assassins Creed for a really long time 😅

At any rate, not much has happened over here, but here are the headlines:

## Did

- Hyper Monday! This was on the 16th of November, I got so much done✝, but also, I knew the crash would come 🙈
- In an effort to see the outside world a bit more often, I started playing Pokemon Go again, and it's been really fun 😄 (FC: 1437-9701-7400)
- NottTechParty: It was such great fun, and lovely to see and catch up with everyone 🎉
- I kicked off the process to get an ADHD assesment!

✝ Incidentally, I saw this tweet and felt very called out, because of days like this one 😅
